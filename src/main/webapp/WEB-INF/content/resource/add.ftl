                A written, printed record of information, evidence, or analysis. Examples from archaeology include published articles, books, excavation
                reports, field notes, or doctoral dissertations.

                A collection of data, usually in tabular form with columns representing variables and rows representing cases. A database usually refers to a
                set of linked or related datasets. Examples from archaeology include small spreadsheets documenting measurements and/or analysis of artifacts,
                as well as large databases cataloging all artifacts from a site.

                In ${siteAcronym}, an ontology is a small file used with a dataset column (and/or coding sheet) to hierarchically organize values in the data in
                order to facilitate integrating datasets from different sources. (Please see the tutorials on data integration for a complete explanation).

            <div class="span4">
                <h3 class="coding_sheet-mid-red"><@link "coding-sheet" "Coding Sheet"/></h3>
                A list of codes and their meanings, usually associated with a single column in a dataset. An example from archaeology might be a list of ceramic
                type codes from a particular analysis project, linked to a specific dataset within ${siteAcronym}. A collection of coding sheets make up a
                coding packet, and are part of the proper documentation of a dataset.

                In ${siteAcronym}, a project is an organizational tool for working with groups of related resources. Projects in ${siteAcronym} are flexible and
                can be used
                in different ways, but it is useful as a starting point to think of a ${siteAcronym} project as a digital archive for materials generated by an
                archaeological research project. It may contain related reports, photographs, maps, and databases, and those resources may inherit metadata
                from the parent project.

                <h3 class="collection-mid-red"><@link "collection" "Collection"/></h3>
                In ${siteAcronym}, a collection is an organizational tool with two purposes. The first is to allow contributors and users to create groups and
                hierarchies of resources in any way they find useful. A secondary use of collections allows users to easily administer view and edit
                permissions for large numbers of persons and resources.
