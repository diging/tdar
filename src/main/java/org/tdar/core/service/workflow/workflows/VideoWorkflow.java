 * The start of the workflow that video files will follow.

 * If we are going to support play back then we need to make sure that there is a mp3 copy. But perhaps we only need to do the conversion when they request the
 * play back to occur? Another approach would be to simply sample the first 10 seconds, say, and then save that sample for play back.

     * We have excluded Matroska because we wonâ€™t know the codec in advance

     * At the moment we only want to upload an save the files, but at a later date we do want to extract extra information.
     * One possible approach would be to use xuggler (http://www.xuggle.com/xuggler/documentation), however we would have to
     * build the jar ourselves, due to the licensing conditions. The formats that are claimed to be supported
     * by xuggler  are here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9727590/what-codecs-does-xuggler-support.

     * Another approach might be to install MediaInfo (http://mediaarea.net/en/MediaInfo) and use JNI to grab the info.
     * More on these two here: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2168472/media-information-extractor-for-java
