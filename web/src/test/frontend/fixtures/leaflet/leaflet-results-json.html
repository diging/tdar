Seven stages of mound construction were identified, with some changes in construction methods and mound configuration over time. As a consequence, Mound 8 provides a record of the transition from an earlier mound form, similar to some stages of the pre-Classic mound at the Gatlin Site, to a later form similar to patterns evident in other Classic period sites.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Mound 8 precinct as a whole changes with these modifications of the central feature. From these physical changes, shifts in the function and use of Mound 8 have been inferred. Among these is an apparent transition from a predominantly ritual function to one of residence, probably by an elite group within the general population.\r\n\r\nA comparison of these aspects of the Mound 8 precinct with characteristics of other known platform mounds is made. Although no precise parallel to Stage VI at Las Colinas is identified, strong similarities of the remaining construction stages to those at other sites indicate that\r\nthere was a shared concept of the appropriate formal organization of the mounds, which might be presumed to reflect similarities in their function within the society.","id":4528,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/4528/the-1982-1984-excavations-at-las-colinas-the-mound-8-precinct"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-31.527914172356592,55.44004503676645]},"properties":{"title":"The 1982-1984 Excavations at Las Colinas: The Site and Its Features","description":"In this volume the features and deposits discovered and excavated at Las Colinas outside the Mound 8 precinct are described.

With a few notable exceptions, much of the older data on Northern Rio Grande burials is presented as summaries without regards to age or sex and without definitions of exactly what is meant by the terms used to describe even basic treatment such as orientation and body position. Thus, the typical level of reporting is insufficient to answer most research questions and leaves the impression that there either is little or no consistency in how bodies were treated or that the burial program was extremely complex. Recent excavations at sites in the Tewa and Galisteo Basins of Northern New Mexico have recovered small to significant numbers of human burials. To manage and begin to compare burial practices between several projects required a data base that could be used to summarize demography, grave location and characteristics, body position, and grave goods as well as explore patterns within and between the sites. Some of this data suggests that decisions concerning the details of burial are made at the extended family level, but other decisions have a broader significance that we are just beginning to recognize. A regional data base could not only provide additional information to examine a wide range of questions but would improve our reporting and recording of burial encountered in the future.

Documentary records were used to identify networks of\r\ninteraction at the ranch itself and in the surrounding region, providing a\r\ncontext of social and economic change within which behavior at the ranch\r\ncould be studied.\r\n     Keys' Ranch was associated with the development of local cattle\r\nranching, cycles of mining activity, homesteading, the creation of a rival\r\ncommunity at nearby Twentynine Palms Oasis, the Depression economy of the 1930s and the development of the desert retirement and recreation industries. Regional networks of social interaction were centered in several\r\nnodes, or loci, with connections extending to the California coast and the\r\nColorado River. Keys' Ranch was one of several such nodes during various times in regional history. The overall pattern of regional change, however, featured a reduction in the number and an increase in the size of such nodes, as is typical of the passing frontier. Keys' Ranch's function as\r\nan interaction center was eventually eclipsed by the permanent settlement\r\nand development of land around Twentynine Palms. A study of the ranch in\r\nterms of its relationship to changing interaction networks should be useful\r\nto our understanding of \"frontiers\" in general. The responses of\r\nxanch occupants to the ranch's diminishing role as an interaction node\r\nshould help us understand how other groups might respond to similar changes on other \"frontiers.\"\r\n     In this analysis a distinction is made between social, or behavioral,\r\nphenomena and cultural, or perceptual, phenomena. The kinds, quantities\r\nand distribution of materials at Keys' Ranch contain information descriptive\r\nof Keys' social behavior as expressed in specific activities, such as\r\nconstruction, repair, recycling and use of the natural environment. The\r\ninformation contained in material at the ranch, as well as in documentary\r\nsources, can also tell us about Keys' system of personal relationships,\r\nreflected, for example, in changes in ranch personnel and in exchanges of\r\ngoods and services. Information derived from material distributions,\r\ndocuments and oral testimony can help us understand Keys' response to\r\ncultural phenomena, including changing systems of statuses associated with changes in the regional socioeconomic system. The creation of statuses-here defined as sets of expectations about the rights and duties associated with particular social positions--in the region is traced insofar as is possible on the basis of available documentation; it is suggested that the organization of materials at the ranch Can be interpreted as reflective of changing statuses. A major objective of this study has been to indicate\r\nhow written, oral and material records pertinent to the ranch might be\r\nstudied in a way that will help us learn about cultural, as well as social,\r\nchange.\r\n","id":3958,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/3958/an-anthropological-evaluation-of-william-keys-desert-queen-ranch-joshua-tree-national-monument-california"}}],"type":"FeatureCollection","properties":{"totalRecords":644,"startRecord":0,"description":null,"recordsPerPage":100,"title":"Collection: \" json crud \" ","url":"http://localhost:8080/search/rss?webObfuscation=true&recordsPerPage=100&latScaleUsed=true&collectionId=2596&startRecord=0"}}

The work in 1996 was conducted\r\nfrom June 17th to July 26th by 13 field school students earning credits from the University of Virginia.  In 1997, 18 field school students, again earning credits from the University of Virginia, worked\r\nat the site from June 30th to July 25th. Archaeologists named the site after the area’s first documented land owner, the Reverend Richard Buck, who served as the minister at Jamestown from 1610 to 1624. The Buck site, located in James City County, Virginia, on a parcel known as Neck-of-Land in the\r\nPeleg’s Point residential subdivision, is approximately one mile north of Jamestown Island. This report\r\nsummarizes findings from 44JC568.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The artifacts recovered from the site indicated it was occupied from ca. 1630-50.  Historical records included details of Richard Buck’s 1619 patent on 750 acres of land at Neck-of-Land, bounded by Mill Creek on the east, Back River on the south, and Powhatan Creek on the west.  It is unlikely that the Reverend himself lived at Neck-of-Land, residing instead at Jamestown.  Upon Buck’s death in 1624, the property passed into the hands of a caretaker and guardian of his children, Richard Kingsmill.  In 1635, Thomas Crump, husband of Richard Buck’s eldest daughter Elizabeth, acquired the 500 acres directly to the north of the original 750-acre Buck land patent.  Buck’s eldest son Gercian attained his majority in the early 1630s, and in 1636 purchased the 500 acres from his brother-in-law, Thomas. Through this acquisition and the inheritance of his father’s Neck-of-Land property, Gercian amassed a contiguous 1,250-acre tract of land.  Two years later, the youngest Buck sibling, Peleg, inherited the entire property upon Gercian’s death.  Peleg held the land until his own demise in 1642, whereupon Elizabeth Crump assumed ownership until 1654.  Due to the changing ownership of the property between 1619 and 1654, site 44JC568 likely related to a series of resident and non-resident owners, as well as groups of indentured servants and tenants.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>During the two summer field seasons, archaeological crews located and excavated a total of 53 features at 44JC568.  These included three barrel lined wells, nine human burials, four small outbuildings, two pits, a series of ditches and fence lines, and additional miscellaneous soil discolorations and anomalies.  The site yielded more than 12,000 artifacts, consisting primarily of poottery, case-bottle glass, clay tobacco pipe stems and bowls, nails and other iron objects, and faunal remains.  Analysis of the findings suggested that the site served as a farmstead for a series of occupants.  The artifact collection and archaeological context offered insights into the outfitting and operation of one of Virginia’s earliest attempts at settling Jamestown’s hinterland.</p>","id":6079,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/6079/archaeological-excavations-at-44jc568-the-reverend-richard-buck-site"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{},"properties":{"title":"Archaeological Excavations at Jordan's Point: Sites 44PG151, 44PG300, 44PG302, 44PG303, 44PG315, 44PG333","description":"<p>This volume is a technical report on the excavations of six archaeological sites at Jordan's Point: 44PG151, 44PG300, 44PG302, 44PG303, 44PG315, and 44PG333.

The project was sponsored by the Arizona Department of Transportation (ADOT) and the Museum of Northern Arizona (MNA) was contracted by HNTB Engineers, consultants to ADOT, to complete the archaeological studies. Field work was conducted during May, June and July, 1986.\r\n\r\nPrehistoric resources identified during the testing consisted of two canal alignments and habitation features which date to the late Pioneer and Colonial periods of the Hohokam culture, ca. A.D. 600-950. The remains are located within the boundaries of the large Classic period village\r\nmapped by Midvale as the Dutch Canal ruin. Classic period remains found during this project, however, were limited to only two redware sherds.\r\n\r\nThe research design was structured towards identifying temporal and functional aspects of the canals and domestic features, and the relationship between the canals and domestic features. Various chronometric methods, including the experimental dating of canal sediments by archaeomagnetic techniques, were successfully used in\r\ndetermining the age of features. Botanical data was used to assess feature and site function and to reconstruct the general vegetation patterns and the resources which were exploited.\r\n\r\nA reconstruction of prehistoric land use patterns indicates that this area of the first terrace of the Salt River during the late Pioneer and Colonial periods was a specialized agricultural work station. The structures were\r\nused as field houses in association with irrigation agriculture. Three canals date to the late Pioneer and early Colonial periods and may be part of the earliest canal system built along the north side of the Salt River.\r\n\r\nIn addition, a significant historic study was completed which focused on the historic Dutch Ditch and later use of the first terrace. Numerous historic features associated with early housing developments were encountered during testing and excavation. A history of land ownership and\r\ndevelopment was compiled and Berney Park, a municipal facility established by Leo S. Berney, was researched. \r\n\r\nDue to the obvious early nature of the canals and associated habitation features, research focused on documentation of Hohokam land use and chronometric studies. These investigations serve to document the presence of intact, buried remains on the first terrace of the Salt River associated with early Hohokam occupation. These studies have served to broaden understanding of Hohokam land use patterns and the development of canal irrigation.","id":4419,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/4419/archaeological-investigations-at-the-dutch-canal-ruin-phoenix-arizona-archaeology-and-history-along-the-papago-freeway-corridor"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-86.97005971065721,-62.354959212647366]},"properties":{"title":"Archaeological Investigations at the Grand Canal Ruins: A Classic Period Site in Phoenix, Arizona Volume 1","description":"This report presents the results of the archaeological excavation of a prehistoric Hohokam village known as the Grand canal Ruins (AZ T:12:14 and AZ T:12:16 [ASU]). Excavations were performed at the site in 1986 in advance of the Squaw Peak Parkway, a city-funded transportation project located in Phoenix, Arizona. The archaeological work was conducted by Soil Systems, Inc., for the City of Phoenix under Contract Nos. 41116 and 42877.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canal Ruins represent a large Classic period settlement occupied from around A.D. 1100 to 1450. Over 200 features were identified in the portion of the site investigated and consisted of habitation features, large roasting pits (hornos), midden deposits, irrigation canals, and a large cemetery. The habitation features included pithouses, adobe-walled structures, and a compound. The cemetery extended over the\r\nentire project area and contained 79 inhumation and 22 cremation burials. Analysis of the site and its features focused on chronology and site structure, subsistence, mortuary variability, material culture, and settlement patterns.\r\n\r\nChronometric dates and ceramic seriation were used to identify periods of settlement occupation and growth. The site was initially established during the Santan phase (ca. A.D. 1075-1100), attained its maximum extent during the Soho and Civano phases (ca. A.D. 1100-1350/1375), and was abandoned sometime during the Polvorón phase (A.D. 1375-1450). Subsistence studies indicated reliance on domesticated (corn, cotton, bean, and squash) and nondomesticated resources (cactus, agave, mesquite, and small mammals). Irrigation canals in the vicinity probably supplied local agricultural fields. The investigated large cemetery provided\r\nabundant information on Hohokam burial practices, osteology, and material culture. Unequal distributions of grave goods were used to examine Classic period social organization. Osteological analysis was used to examine the health, biology, demography, and cultural affinity of this population. Material culture studies focused on the nearly 400 ceramic vessels recovered as well as a variety of stone, shell, and bone artifacts.\r\n\r\nThe Grand Canal Ruins represent the northernmost settlement within Canal System 2 and the site is discussed in terms of settlement hierarchies and irrigation community organization.

Excavations were performed at the site in 1986 in advance of the Squaw Peak Parkway, a city-funded transportation project located in Phoenix, Arizona. The archaeological work was conducted by Soil Systems, Inc., for the City of Phoenix under Contract Nos. 41116 and 42877. The Grand Canal Ruins represent a large Classic period settlement occupied from around A.D. 1100 to 1450. Over 200 features were identified in the portion of the site investigated and consisted of habitation features, large roasting pits (hornos), midden deposits, irrigation canals, and a large cemetery. The habitation features included pithouses, adobe-walled structures, and a compound. The cemetery extended over the entire project area and contained 79 inhumation and 22 cremation burials. Analysis of the site and its features focused on chronology and site structure, subsistence, mortuary variability, material culture, and settlement patterns. Chronometric dates and ceramic seriation were used to identify periods of settlement occupation and growth. The site was initially established during the Santan phase (ca. A.D. 1075-1100), attained its maximum extent during the Soho and Civano phases (ca. A.D. 1100-1350/1375), and was abandoned sometime during the Polvorón phase (A.D. 1375-1450). Subsistence studies indicated reliance on domesticated (corn, cotton, bean, and squash) and nondomesticated resources (cactus, agave, mesquite, and small mammals). Irrigation canals in the vicinity probably supplied local agricultural fields. The investigated large cemetery provided abundant information on Hohokam burial practices, osteology, and material culture. Unequal distributions of grave goods were used to examine Classic period social organization. Osteological analysis was used to examine the health, biology, demography, and cultural affinity of this population. Material culture studies focused on the nearly 400 ceramic vessels recovered as well as a variety of stone, shell, and bone artifacts. The Grand Canal Ruins represent the northernmost settlement within Canal System 2 and the site is discussed in terms of settlement hierarchies and irrigation community organization. This settlement was part of the La Ciudad occupation zone, which may have been administered by a lineage-based authority. It is proposed that the occupation zones were under independent jurisdiction and acted cooperatively to regulate and maintain the large irrigation systems.","id":4414,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/4414/archaeological-investigations-at-the-grand-canal-ruins-a-classic-period-site-in-phoenix-arizona-volume-2"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-17.0,65.6]},"properties":{"title":"Archaeological investigations in Mývatnssveit 2007 (field report)","description":"this should not be null","id":3268,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/3268/archaeological-investigations-in-myvatnssveit-2007-field-report"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-45.25,60.65]},"properties":{"title":"Archaeological Investigations in Vatnahverfi, Greenland 2008 Season Preliminary Report (field report)","description":"this should not be null","id":3253,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/3253/archaeological-investigations-in-vatnahverfi-greenland-2008-season-preliminary-report-field-report"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-111.12258911132812,33.84708503404919]},"properties":{"title":"Archaeological Palynology and Correspondence Analysis: A Case Study","description":"Paper presented at the IX International Pollen Conference, Archaeological Palynology Symposium, Houston TX.","id":6282,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/6282/archaeological-palynology-and-correspondence-analysis-a-case-study"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-110.75180053710938,34.6239852944324]},"properties":{"title":"Archaeological Palynology at AZ 2282: The Pilot Study","description":"Study of a collection of pollen samples collected from AZ 22822 during\r\nsummer, 1998.

A small percentage of archaeological monuments and sites are strikingly scenic and project themselves into our view.  Examples of such obvious landscape features include:  Egyptian and Mesoamerian pyramids and their associated building complexes;  monumental earthen architecture such as Monks Mound at Cahokia and Serpent Mound in Ohio; and, ancient cliffdwellings in the American Southwest, such as Cliff Palace at Mesa Verde and Montezuma Castle in Arizona.  Some archaeological resources emerge from their subterranean context in some areas, like the visible portions of icebergs, while remaining concealed to simple human vision in other parts of the site.  The long band of wall segments, fortified gates, camps, and associated structures that comprises Hadrian's Wall in northern England is an example of this kind of on-again-off-again contribution to what we can see in our modern view.  The wall and its related structures are strikingly part of the modern scene in some of the rural middle portions of its length, but dive under the surface in the urban areas at its eastern and western extents.  In most instances, archaeological sites are completely hidden beneath the modern surface and to be viewed must be uncovered to be viewed, such as at Independence National Historical Park in Philadelphia where the foundations and hearths of the last home that Benjamin Franklin occupied have been excavated and exposed as part of public intepretive program describing the life and times of this American icon.\r\n\r\nIn all but a few parts of the world the archaeological record is invisible.  Most often the remains of past dwellings and other structures, places of activity, ceremony, manufacturing, and sport are covered by new buildings, roads, soil, and vegetation.  Yet, nearly all individuals, cultures, or groups that inhabit a place leave some material trace of themselves and their uses of the place behind them.  \r\nWhen discovered, carefully documented, and interpreted, these material traces provide links between the past inhabitants of a place and its contemporary dwellers who occupied it in the present.  Common use of the same place by different groups through time can serve to connect individuals of different backgrounds and cultures.  Drawing contections with what happened in a place before they arrived at it provides modern inhabitants with the opportunity to reflect not only on the past of the place, but also on their own modern way of life. \r\n\r\nThe materials in this project provide examples of and reflections about situations in which archaeological remains have served to anchor contemporary designs, facilities, or landscapes in time through the incorporation of ancient or historic period archaeological remains, or representations of them in modern spatial designs.  Issues of conservation; the depiction of multiple historical interpretations;  the nature of representation;  and the involvement of local communities and of modern descendents of ancient and historic groups in projects are considered by the contributors.\r\n  ","id":6027,"resourceType":"PROJECT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/project/6027/archaeological-resources-in-design-and-landscape"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{},"properties":{"title":"An Archaeological Study of Colonial Chesapeake Culture","description":"Using detailed comparisons of the archaeological assemblages from 18 early sites in the Chesapeake, this project explores the material conditions of culture contact, plantation development and organization, the rise of slavery, and consumer behavior.

Unlike most books dealing with archaeological subjects, the reading is engaging, conjuring images of massacre and mayhem at early\r\nMartin’s Hundred. The characters Noël Hume portrays—Harwood, Kingston, “Granny”—tend to be like those in a good conundrum, worldly and well-to-do, made noteworthy in the Martin’s Hundred story by the array of artifacts they left behind. The armor, silver inlaid tableware, gold threads, and other personal accouterments, do, however accidently, leave an impression that the majority of immigrants from the mother country were members of the fairly well-heeled English gentry. But the archaeological\r\nevidence of the Martin’s Hundred community, obtained during more recent field work at Carter’s Grove, mainly the 1990 and 1991 surveys and the full-scale excavation of site 44JC647, reveals quite a different life for many residents in the second quarter of the seventeenth century.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>It is in this period, between 1625 and 1650, that a community developed at Martin’s Hundred. David Muraca’s M.A. thesis explores the development and settlement logistics of this community (Muraca 1993), and it is from his observations that an examination of the nature of this phase, specifically its economic and social characteristics, can be made. Noël Hume has skillfully described what appears to be the upper echelon of Martin’s Hundred during this period, with his detailed description of Sites A and B, but little is mentioned of sites representing people on the other end of the\r\neconomic ladder. If the archaeological record of these artifactually-challenged sites is properly analyzed for positive and negative evidence, rather than considered uninteresting anomalies, these poorer sites can serve as valuable foils to the wealthy locales most frequently excavated in Tidewater over the last twenty years.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>The purpose of this report is to describe in some detail the excavation of one of these “poorer sites” and thereby attempt to learn more about a segment of early Virginia society often overlooked in both the archaeological and written records of the period. Chapter 2 reviews the environmental conditions of Tidewater Virginia. Chapter 3 will attempt to place the initial exploration and colonization of Virginia in the context of the expanding horizons and expanding problems in Europe that lead to the\r\nconquest of new territories in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Chapter 4 deals specifically with the methods and techniques of data recovery that were used by Colonial Williamsburg’s Department of Archaeological Research in the excavation of site 44JC647. Chapter 5 describes the layers and features encountered, specifically examining soil chemistry and paleoethnobotanical remains. Chapter 6 examines the artifactual material recovered from the plowzone and refuse pits, concentrating on smoking pipes and ceramics. Chapters 7 and 8 will attempt to place JC647 and four other contemporary Martin’s Hundred sites in perspective. Through this examination it is\r\nhoped that a better understanding of inequality in early seventeenth-century colonial Virginia can be derived.</p>","id":6078,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/6078/archaeology-of-a-seventeenth-century-houselot-at-martins-hundred-virginia"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-95.73845245907856,25.120935780918455]},"properties":{"title":"The Archaeology of African Burial Ground National Monument, New York","description":"A collection of Park Service reports and supporting documents from archaeological work done at the African Burial Ground National Monument in lower Manhattan, New York, New York.

The discussion is intended as a provocative introduction to the archaeology of highland Chiriquí rather than an exhaustive exploration and seeks to convey the contemporary context of an understudied archaeological region. Chiriquí, like the isthmus of Panamá overall, inhabits a nebulous place in archaeological conception due to its positioning below Mesoamerica and above the Andean world. This academic displacement is further complicated – or potentially prompted - by the de-contextualization of vast quantities of pre-Columbian artifacts in the late nineteenth century after large cemeteries were discovered in 1859 and then subjected to several decades of intensive excavation by individuals seeking monetary gain, adventure, or both from the experience.   Antiquities removed from Chiriquí at this time were transported to museum collections throughout the western world. While the removed artifacts attest to the richness of pre-Columbian material culture, the sites from which they came were effectively erased from the landscape and archaeological conception. I draw from diverse, ephemeral and cartographically imprecise sources of information provided by accounts from looters and adventurers, antiquarian reports, museum accession files, and rumor to extrapolate possible locations for looted sites that provided the materials held in the major museum collections. I place these ‘un-firm’ locations in a GIS in conjunction with precisely located sites from systematic survey to show how they relate to one another. A concomitant role of this article is to make data from fieldwork I conducted between 2000 and 2005 in highland Chiriquí accessible to other researchers. In this article, I tease out one particular grave and the materials used to construct it from these data as synecdoche for myriad thousands of looted Chiriquí graves as well as the archaeological need to seek new forms of data.\r\n\r\nPreparation of this electronic publication and associated archive was assisted by a grant from the Andrew W.

Accompanied by their parents, the boys brought their finds into Colonial Williamsburg’s archaeology laboratory to see if the fragments were important. The curators at the lab are frequently called on to identify recently unearthed objects, most of which turn out to be modern castoffs. Once in a great while, however, someone comes in with an artifact that is an impressive example of colonial craftsmanship or that has a significant provenience. What the boys found fell into the latter category, and their visit would trigger a massive archaeological investigation that would take eight years to complete. It had been a long-standing research goal of Colonial Williamsburg’s Department of Archaeological Research (D.A.R.) to investigate the colonial plantations that surrounded\r\nWilliamsburg, and the date of manufacture for the artifacts found by the children indicated they had stumbled onto one. An excavation team dispatched to explore the housing development quickly uncovered other artifacts and architectural remains associated with a seventeenth-century plantation known as Rich Neck near where the boys were playing, as well as the remains of an early nineteenth-century slave quarter.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>In 1992, McCale Development Corporation planned to develop the area as part of the Holly Hills residential development, and as part of their proffer to the city they contracted with the D.A.R. to evaluate the archaeological significance of the seventeenth-century site. Test units, placed at 10 meter intervals, uncovered several artifact concentrations and the remains of a brick foundation. That brickwork later proved to be only one of a number of structures located on Rich Neck’s homelot\r\n(Muraca 1993). Even though the site had been plowed throughout the nineteenth century and later logged in the early 1900s, it was still in excellent shape.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Recognizing the scale and importance of these findings, Colonial Williamsburg, the McCale Development Corporation, and the City of Williamsburg agreed to sponsor efforts to excavate the site. Colonial Williamsburg accordingly made plans to use its summer field school, run in conjunction with the College of William & Mary, to accomplish the task. The excavation was originally conceived as a salvage operation that would last only ten weeks. Midway through the summer, however, it became apparent that completion within this time frame was impossible given the growing size and complexity of the site. In response, McCale adjusted property boundaries so that the site’s major components could be encompassed within two lots, which the City and Colonial Williamsburg then purchased and agreed to sell when the excavation was completed. The developer established two rules which were in effect for the entire dig. No machinery was to be used and no live trees with a diameter\r\ngreater than 4 inches could be cut down.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>With a new schedule in place, the field school spent the remainder of the first summer investigating features outside of the purchased lots, and after the field school was over, a professional crew continued this work for an additional two months. From 1994 through 2000 field schools returned to work at the site for ten weeks each summer. In 1998, Colonial Williamsburg sold its lot to individuals interested in preserving the site permanently. The city has just recently sold its parcel as well, but with a protective easement to shield the surviving architectural remains from destruction\r\nduring the lot’s development.</p>\r\n\r\n<p>Also found at the site was a slave quarter that was part of eighteenth-century Rich Neck. It was located on the northern edge of the seventeen-century complex and was excavated in 1994 and 1995 by Maria Franklin and Anna Agbe-Davies. Separate reports exist for these excavations (Franklin 1997; Agbe-Davies 1999). Most of the initial salvage excavation focused on the area in the path of the\r\ndevelopment’s main road. Plowed layers in this area were removed by machine, exposing numerous features including two post-in-ground structures, fences, a trash pit, and a man-made ditch—all of which were excavated. During these hectic first few weeks, field school students were instructed to hastily shovel away large areas of plowed soils without the benefit of screens in order to get at features that had survived underneath. Of course, both techniques resulted in a permanent loss of data, and after the time constraints were lifted a new excavation strategy was implemented that allowed plow zone material to be recovered over the rest of the site.</p>","id":6081,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/6081/the-archaeology-of-rich-neck-plantation-44wb52-description-of-the-features"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[154.24903661395,9.290770495430383]},"properties":{"title":"The Archaeology of Rota, Northern Mariana Islands","description":"This project includes archaeological data about the archaeological record of Rota Island, in the Northern Mariana Islands, Micronesia.

The subject of legend both ancient and modern, it is one of the most impressive and familiar of all surviving Hohokam sites. Until recently, any visitor could plainly see from exposed rooms, deteriorating walls, and eroding test holes and tunnels that Pueblo Grande had been extensively excavated. It would have been logical to assume from this evidence that the site was one of the most famous and best documented of all Classic period Hohokam villages.\r\n\r\nUntil the present study, however, Pueblo Grande has been one of the least understood of all Hohokam sites. Due to a long series of conflicts and\r\nmisunderstandings, the vast majority of the archaeological excavations conducted at Pueblo Grande remained unreported and, therefore, widely unknown. Despite the information resulting from these excavations, the site was seldom mentioned in the archaeological literature, and it was assumed by Hohokam scholars that the most important excavation\r\nrecords from Pueblo Grande had been lost or discarded. As with all too many sites, Pueblo Grande was written off by many archaeologists as\r\na casualty of an earlier archaeological philosophy that considered the collection of artifacts and the exposure of architecture more important than the systematic recording of information.\r\n\r\nWe now know this viewpoint was unwarranted; the Pueblo Grande Museum Archives (PGMA) contain a wealth of information from past excavations.

Great Island is part of the Cape Cod National Seashore (hereafter abbreviated CACO) of the National Park\r\nService (hereafter abbreviated NPS). The focus of this project is on the Great Island Tavern site (hereafter abbreviated GIT) because of it's research significance to historical archeologists and because of the paucity of data and information for the other three sites.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this collections project is on recataloging, reorganization, and evaluation of archeological remains excavated from the Great Island site. Several small bags of artifacts from three historic sites located during a judgemental survey of Island also are dealt with and discussed within this report (Table 1.1).\r\n\r\nThe archeological field work on Great Island in 1969 and 1970 was directed by Erik Ekholm and James Deetz, research associate and staff archeologist respectively, for Plimoth Plantation at the time. Because Great Island is part of the Cape Cod National Seashore, the work was initiated and\r\nfunded by the NPS under the supervision of John L. Cotter, then Regional Archeologist for the Northeast Office in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe GIT site originally was found by NPS archeologists during a survey of Great Island in the late 1960's. Local tradition suggested that the site was either the remains of seventeenth century Dutch trading post or a tavern operated by a Samuel Smith (Ekholm and Deetz 1971:49). Hence the\r\npurpose of Ekholm and Deetz's archeological excavations was to determine the site's date and identify its function before unauthorized excavations further disturbed the original context of the site (Deetz 1977:33; Ekholm and Deetz 1970a:l). The archeological survey was conducted in the spring of 1970 after library research revealed that lengthy human occupation and ecological change for. Great\r\nIsland in particular, and the Wellfleet area in general (Erik Ekholm, 1970:1) had occurred. \r\n\r\nThe GIT site was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1977 as the Samuel Smith Tavern site. This name was chosen because local folk tradition stated that this site was the remains of Samuel Smith's tavern (Ekholm and Deetz 1970a:4). Ekholm and Deetz (1971) termed the site the\r\nWellfleet Tavern because of its location within the town of Wellfleet. Since then, the Division of Cultural Resources has decided to change the site's name to the Great Island Tavern because it identifies the site's location more specifically.","id":5902,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/5902/archeological-collections-management-of-the-great-island-tavern-site-cape-cod-national-seashore-massachusetts"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-112.01934814453125,36.00578097723616]},"properties":{"title":"Archeological Data Recovery at the Rim of the Grand Canyon, Shoshone Point Grand Canyon National Park, Arizona","description":"Archeologists from the Western archeological and Conservation Center completed archeological data recovery in June and July 2005 in advance of the construction of a vault toilet in the multicomponent site, AZ B:16:680. The proposed toilet will be installed near a thermal feature,\r\nFeature 6, and will adversely affect or destroy the information likely to be yielded from its subsurface deposits. With Arizona SHPO concurrence, the park’s cultural resources personnel developed a research design to complete a 100-percent surface collection and instrument map of the entire site, and data recovery in the footprint of the proposed toilet and in Feature 6. Nineteen STUs and 6 formal XUs were opened within the APE. Approximately 3,200 artifacts were retrieved from the surface or recovered from the subsurface of the site; a little more than one-quarter of these artifacts were analyzed in the laboratory at WACC.\r\n\r\nFrom the analysis of all the data, a complete site map was created from precise instrumentation. The new site map accurately depicts the site’s topographic relief and artifact distribution. This map provides the park with real data to formulate future management recommendations and plans for\r\nthis site as needed. The data collected from the analysis of the artifacts suggest that Feature 6 is a thermal feature, but not a roasting pit.

The purpose of the investigation was to obtain baseline\r\ninformation about potential historic properties within the crater, information that KALA will use in developing an integrated management plan for the crater's natural and cultural resources.\r\n\r\nThe interior of the crater exhibited a more or less continuous distribution of archaeological features. For descriptive purposes, thirty-two sites containing 333 features were defined. The sites consist of permanent and temporary habitations, a trail system, a potential heiau, a possible burial\r\nsite, agricultural sites, and an agricultural complex with 269 features. These sites and features are interpreted as a large agricultural and residential complex dating from at least the early Historic Period, and possibly from late prehistoric times. The possible pre-Contact era permanent habitation sites are located on the crater's upper benches. Caves and rockshelters, which contain evidence of temporary habitation, also likely date to pre-Contact times. The bulk of the large rectilinear\r\nagricultural fields and potential storage enclosures in the crater appear to have been in use until at least the mid-nineteenth century. From a research standpoint it is recommended that KALA develop a plan for limited subsurface investigations sufficient to obtain samples for radiocarbon analysis. From a management standpoint it is recommended that KALA prepare a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places (NRHP) for Kauhako Crater to be listed as an archaeological district It is\r\nfelt that such a nomination is warranted given the density and obvious contextual and temporal associations ofthe sites and features.

Although artifacts recovered indicate ties to the Hopi, Homol'ovi, Flagstaff, Zuni, and Gallup areas, the pueblo's location near petrified wood sources does not appear to have engendered large-scale lithic manufacturing for trade. Some evidence suggests that the focus of trade may have shifted from west to east during the occupation, but most items were made from locally-available raw material.\r\n\r\nDating of the site and regional environmental data suggest the pueblo was\r\nfounded during a period of drought conditions. In the early part of the\r\noccupation, there was a heavy reliance on domestic crops, most likely grown in the Puerco River floodplain; later, more wild plants appear to have been used. A wide variety and high percentage of non-traditional food animals, such as carnivores, also appear to have been consumed, possibly indicating environmental stress.","id":4292,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/4292/archeological-investigations-at-puerco-ruin-petrified-forest-national-park-arizona"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-48.50644877413973,-21.98764274074949]},"properties":{"title":"Archeological Investigations at the Upper Ruin, Tonto National Monument Part 1 Salvage Excavations at the Upper Ruin, AZ U:8:48 (ASM) - 1995","description":"Fox, Gregory L, Western Archeological and Conservation Center, 1415 North Sixth Avenue, Tucson, AZ 85705. SALVAGE EXCAVATIONS AT THE UPPER RUIN (AZ U:8:48)-1995, TONTO NATIONAL MONUMENT\r\n\r\nContinuing water damage to adobe and masonry structures in the Upper Ruin (AZ U:8:48), Tonto National Monument, required archeological excavations to mitigate the adverse effects of stabilization efforts in this Gila-phase cliff dwelling. The data-recovery project was required\r\nunder Section 106 ofthe National Historic Preservation Act, because this site is a contributing property to the Tonto National Monument Archeological District. Limited excavations, employing differential recovery techniques, were placed in Area A at the rear of the rockshelter\r\nadjacent to Rooms 17 and 19 to discover the cause of the water damage and to remove intact deposits of cultural materials prior to correcting the drainage pattern and repairing the damage to the rooms. A total of 7 square meters of surface area was removed from the shelter floor to\r\nexpose and repair the drainage problem.\r\n\r\nAlthough these excavations fall under the rubric of salvage excavations, new data derived from the analyses of the recovered cultural materials and ancillary investigations conducted as an integral part of this project will require adjustments in the National Park Service's interpretation\r\nofthis National Register property. In particular, the first, formal absolute dates for the occupation of the shelter were generated as part of this stabilization project. Dendrochronological dates and radiocarbon assays now place the occupation of the cliff dwelling as early as A.D. 1303 and\r\npotentially as late as A.D. 1473. The site and domestic structures are now considered to represent an occupation that began during either the late Roosevelt phase (Early Classic period) or the early Gila phase (Late Classic period).

The fieldwork encompassed four separate field data collection projects, building on previous WACC surveys from 1994 to 1996 and adding to the inventory of cultural resources iu the Park. Cumulative survey results now represent more than 30 percent coverage of Park lands, providing a comprehensive cultural resources database for both districts. The projects shared the primary goal of developiug cultural resources inventories for the park expansion lands. But each project also served secondary goals such as surveying areas proposed as possible\r\nroutes for newly desiguated trails, relocatiug and re-recordiug several well-known prehistoric and historic sites, and relocating other previously recorded sites for site condition and siguificance assessments. In\r\naddition to the firndamental imperative of preservation, all fieldwork goals served the overarching purpose of providing detailed cultural resources information to assist park management and aid in planning decisions. The authors also hope this report proves to be a useful tool for future research.\r\n\r\nThe first project presented is SAGU 1996 C, an inventory survey covering over 400 acres of foothills and uplands in the Riucon Mountain District (RMO) Park expansion lands. Four sites and fourteen isolated finds were recorded. The recorded sites are prehistoric, while the isolated finds represent a mix of prehistoric and historical cultural materials. The second reported project is SAGU 1997 A, which contiuued the survey in a\r\ncontiguous block south of the SAGU 1996 C survey area. Duriug this project more than 830 acres were covered, and II sites, including prehistoric sites and historic-period ranchiug and mining sites, were newly\r\nrecorded. The survey also recorded 43 prehistoric and historic-period isolated tinds and re-recorded two previously identified sites. One of the re-recorded sites is the well-known Loma Alta site, a large Hohokam village on Rincon Creek. The project, SAGU 1997 B, focused on a block of newly acquired park lands in the Tucson Mountaiu District (TMD), covering an area of more than 820 acres. Prehistoric and historic-period cultural resources were recorded at three sites in this survey area along with 55 prehistoric, historical, and modern isolated finds. The series of new lands surveys iu the park was concluded during project SAGU 1998 A, which included both reconnaissance and inventory surveys in both park districts. Extensive reconnaissance survey was combined with block survey of approximately 120 acres in the Rincon Mountain District. Eighteen previously recorded sites were relocated, and site condition and significance assessments were made. In addition, two previously known sites were completely re-recorded, includiug the large Hohokam village known as the Camino Loma Alta site. Finally, six prehistoric and historic-period sites were recorded in the Riucon Mountain District. Work duriug 1998 in the TMD iucluded reconnaissance surveys in the Mile Wide Mine locality, where several historic-period mining sites were recorded, including the well-known Mile Wide Mine. Block surveys also were conducted, totaliug about 720 acres in several areas of newly acquired lands, and around proposed routes of newly desiguated trails. Thirteen prehistoric and historic-period sites were recorded in the TMD and the site records were completed at two other sites, including the Old Yuma Mine. Finally, 17 isolated finds of prehistoric and historical cultural materials were\r\nrecorded in both park districts.\r\n\r\nThis report includes summary descriptions of the four projects, including goals and data collection methods for each one. Survey results are organized by survey project and a comparative summary of the cultural\r\nresources recorded in both park districts is offered. Site condition and significance assessments are presented for all recorded cultural resources as well as previously recorded sites. Since a summary approach generally is used in the body of the report, it is followed by detailed descriptions of sites, isolated finds, and analyzed artifacts in appendices. The appendices also include a concordance of site numbers and a review of the record of previous excavations at the Loma Alta site.","id":4334,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/4334/archeological-survey-of-newly-acquired-lands-in-saguaro-national-park-1996-1997-and-1998"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-113.477783203125,36.04191554934114]},"properties":{"title":"Archeological Survey of Proposed Prescribed Burn Units and Trail Rehabilitation on the Shivwits Plateau of Parashant National Monument, Arizona","description":"During May of 1999 a WACC archeological crew surveyed 700 acres on the southern Shivwits Plateau to identify cultural resources in planned burn units and preceding trail maintenance on Mt.

The farm is adjacent to Minidoka Internment National Monument and was recently purchased by The Conservation Fund for eventual transfer to\r\nthe National Park Service. Ninety-six features (including five buildings) and 12 isolated artifacts were recorded during the survey. No features or artifacts predating the relocation center were found. Most of the recorded features and isolated artifacts are from the John Herrmann Farm, including the residence, a milking barn and corral, farm equipment, and the irrigation system. Significant relocation center features within the Herrmann Farm include the fire station, the root cellar, and remains of the\r\nsewage treatment plant and other infrastructure. Because of the field-clearing during the farm era, there are no foundations remaining in the residential blocks, and few artifacts on the ground surface. However, the John Herrmann Farm itself is important, too, both in itself and for its relationship with the relocation center. The farm illustrates how relocation center land was disposed, often to war veterans, and how many relocation center buildings were recycled as part of the next stage of\r\nsettlement. As one of a few “Farm-In-A-Day” promotions in the country, the farm provides a living example of Idaho homesteading history. Recommendations include actions to preserve significant buildings, features, and information, and to enhance the interpretive potential of the property.

The site contains an abundance of artifacts on the surface, including Adamana Brown pottery, the\r\nearliest identified ware in the region. \r\n\r\nTwo eroding pit structures, two extramural units, and five shovel tests were excavated at the site. In addition, archeologists conducted a systematic surface collection of artifacts in a 180-square-meter area. Over the course of the project, two extramural features were excavated and three main stratigraphic divisions were discerned. Over 3,600 artifacts, ecofacts, and other samples were collected, including four complete or fully restorable Adamana Brown vessels, a partially restorable Adamana Brown vessel, 1,072 sherds, over 2,600 flaked stone artifacts, 26 ground-stone artifacts, numerous and varied floral and faunal remains, and over 35 other artifacts and samples. Analyses included soil chemistry, pollen, maerobotanical, and faunal analyses, ceramic and flaked stone classification, radiocarbon, archaeomagnetic, and obsidian hydration dating, and x-ray fluorescence sourcing of obsidian. The current project also allowed a re-evaluation of data (including radiocarbon dating) from the contemporaneous Flattop Site.\r\n\r\nChronometric data indicate a pre-AD. 300 date for occupation at Sivu'ovi and the Flattop Site, perhaps as early as 300 B.C. at Sivu'ovi. However, occupation from AD. 1 to 200 may be the best estimate at this time for the Basketmaker II occupation at both sites. These are the earliest dates yet for sites with ceramics in the middle Little Colorado River region. Lithic analysis indicates that the lithic technology, with a high percentage of formal tools and faceted platforms, shows stronger affinities with the Archaic tradition than with the later Pueblo period, while ground stone at Sivu'ovi most resembles Pueblo period types. In both respects Sivu'ovi appears to be transitional between the Archaic and Pueblo periods.\r\n\r\nPollen, floral, and faunal analyses indicate that the natural environment at the time of occupation of Sivu' ovi was roughly similar to present conditions, but may have been slightly wetter. The ubiquity of maize in the floral and pollen samples suggests a heavy dependence on maize agriculture, but several species of wild plants were used as well. Although limited in number, faunal remains tentatively indicate that jackrabbit, prairie dog, artiodactyls, and turtle were procured. Architecture and artifact caches at both Sivu'ovi and the Flattop Site indicate that the locales served as warm-season residential sites.\r\n\r\nTesting confirmed that Sivu'ovi contains abundant and varied data, and further work at the site is recommended to mitigate the effects of continued erosion and to realize more of the site's information potential.","id":4293,"resourceType":"DOCUMENT","status":"ACTIVE","detailUrl":"http://localhost:8080/document/4293/the-archeology-of-sivuovi-the-archaic-to-basketmaker-transition-at-petrified-forest-national-park"}},{"type":"Feature","geometry":{"type":"Point","coordinates":[-118.15452575683594,36.72731846817143]},"properties":{"title":"The Archeology of Somewhere: Archeological Testing Along U.S. Highway 395 Manzanar National Historic Site, California","description":"The National Park Service conducted archeological investigations at 23 sites, features, and loci along U.S. Highway 395 within and around the Manzanar National Historic Site in Inyo County, California. Caltrans has proposed upgrading the current two-lane highway in the vicinity of the\r\nNational Historic Site to a four-lane divided highway. The archaeological work was deemed necessary to determine the research potential of the cultural resources and to make recommendations about how the\r\nresources should be managed. Archaeological field work included mapping, artifact inventory and collection, and subsurface testing. Most the investigated sites are associated with the town of Manzanar\r\nand date to between 1910 and the early 1930s. Two of the sites have earlier historical components and three have prehistoric components. Six are associated with the World War II Manzanar Relocation Center\r\nand nine are more recent (post 1945). Most of the Relocation Center features in the project area are significant, three of the town-era sites are significant for their information potential, and the one single-component\r\nprehistoric site tested may be significant, depending upon whether there are substantial subsurface cultural deposits in addition to those found during these investigations. All of the significant or potentially significant sites or features are located west of the existing highway and would not be\r\nphysically affected by the proposed highway widening. However, the highway itself is part of the historic Relocation Center-era landscape.

Three areas were excavated during the Songsong archeological project in the summer of 1987 each with deposits relating to three different prehistoric time periods. The archeological\r\nremains found in four of the five excavation blocks recovered prehistoric pottery, stone and shell tools, and animal bones associated with a wide range of domestic activities. Historic period artifacts also were\r\nrecovered, mainly in a 20th century trash midden. Additionally, human burials were found in Area 3.  Information about the chronology of the Songsong remains comes mainly from the association of prehistoric pottery with additional information provided by radiocarbon dates from Area 3.

It is best described as\r\nmarginal to developmental trends shaping the Puebloan world around it, appearing quite conservative in numerous aspects. Residential architecture is one aspect in which the Gallina Phase developed along its own trajectory. The residential pit structures and surface structures are used to evaluate spatial and temporal differences within the Gallina Phase itself and to address long held assumptions regarding the origins and post-Gallina Phase migrations of the Gallina region populations. Comparisons are made between the Gallina region and the Upper San Juan, Chaco, Northern Rio Grande, and Jemez regions of northern New Mexico. Statistical and inferential analyses are employed to test these assumptions. Results reveal the various architectural features from each of the regions are part of a greater pan-Anasazi architectural tradition making statistically significant differences between the Gallina and other regions difficult to recognize. Inferential analysis is then used to evaluate the database. This reveals possible early and late Gallina Phase residential styles and adds insight into overall architectural patterning.

The investigations reported herein were conducted by Soil Systems, Inc. of Phoenix for the Arizona Department of Transportation (Contract No. 85-33). The relevant fieldwork was begun in December 1985 and concluded by the end of 1986. The testing report for the eastern portion of the corridor and the data\r\nrecovery report for the hamlet of La Lomita Pequeña (AZ U:9:66 [ASM]) already have been issued. Reports of data recoveries at El Caserío and La Lomita and one on the canals in the corridor will be produced in the coming months.\r\n\r\nTopically, this report consists of project, environmental, and cultural backgrounds, the latter focused on the growth and development of the prehistoric Hohokam Canal System 2; discussion of chronology, settlement and subsistence patterns, and canals as research domains under investigation; and explanation of the test-trench sampling design:\r\nproject results; feature and site descriptions as specialist studies on canals, ceramics, lithics, flotation, pollen, faunal remains, and mollusks; a summary of biological studies; evaluation of the fieldhouse frequencies:\r\ntesting scheme and and a summary and conclusions regarding the results of these investigations. \r\n\r\nA historic component is present in the corridor, but minimally so and of little consequence. were of greater significance.
