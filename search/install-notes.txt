# note you'll need to install a copy of the JTS (java topology suite) jar
# into the SOLR lib directory to properly get the cores to be setup

# This release upgrades the google analytics script to "universal analytics".  Check to make sure that events are
captured properly.  For example,  take note of some of the event counts prior to testing and a few days after testing.
There numbers should have gone up for all of the event types (pageview, download, share).
